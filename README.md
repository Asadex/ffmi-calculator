# Fat-Free-Mass-Index-Calculator
FFMI Calculator

This is my version of FFMI calculator: https://asadex.github.io/ffmi-calculator/

The site that I was inspired from was Omnicalculator.

I liked the design and decided to do a replica twisting some things as my practice to
developer further my Front End skills.
